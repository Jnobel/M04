        <h2 class="title">The Journey of Creating My First Blog</h2>
        <p class="date">November 21, 2024</p>
        <p>
            Creating my first blog has been an exciting and challenging journey. From setting up a local environment
            with Django to deploying the blog online with PythonAnywhere, every step was a learning experience. Using
            GitHub for version control and VS Code for coding streamlined the process, making development smoother.
            Although there were hurdles, like resolving errors and configuration issues, the satisfaction of seeing the
            blog live made it all worth it.

            Django is an amazing framework for building web applications. Its simplicity and powerful features make it
            an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. I loved how it simplifies tasks like
            database migrations, creating admin panels, and routing. Working through the Django Girls tutorial was a
            great starting point. Though debugging issues like `TemplateDoesNotExist` and deployment errors were tricky,
            they helped deepen my understanding of the framework.

        <h2 class="title">Using PythonAnywhere and VS Code</h2>
        <p class="date">November 21, 2024</p>
        <p>
            PythonAnywhere and VS Code were essential tools in my blogging journey. PythonAnywhere made it easy to host
            my Django app online with minimal setup. Their virtual environments and web app configuration tools were
            straightforward to use. On the other hand, VS Code provided a versatile and user-friendly coding environment.
            Features like extensions, debugging tools, and Git integration made coding and managing my project seamless.
            These tools made the development process much more efficient and enjoyable.
